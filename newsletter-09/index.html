  <h1>SOCHI News: Newsletter 09</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Welcome back to SOCHI News! Hopefully midterms are (or almost) over, and you can finally escape the Ugli before 1am. And since you’ve got time…we’ve got a ton of upcoming events for you to look forward to! Today also marks the 30th anniversary of WikiWikiWeb, the grandfather of Wikipedia. Fun fact: the founder chose the word “wiki”, meaning “quick” in Hawaiian, to reflect the speed of editing a page on WikiWikiWeb. Visit the first user-edited website here.</p>
