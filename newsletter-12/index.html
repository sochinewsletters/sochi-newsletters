  <h1>SOCHI News: Newsletter 12</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Welcome back to SOCHI News! Itâ€™s official â€” weâ€™re at the end. We here at SOCHI are reflecting on how far we came this semester. (Donâ€™t worry, SOCHI News will still be here next year!)</p>
  <p>-Reuben Crasto, Steven Liu</p>

  <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
  <p>Our amazing SOCHI e-board (Reuben, Melp, and Tas!) are getting ready to walk across the stage, and we want to send them off with all the love they deserve. Whether you attended an event, enjoyed the newsletter, or just appreciated their vibes, take a moment to wish them well as they start their next adventure.</p>

  <h2>A Thank You!</h2>
  <p>As we near the end of the semester and classes wrap up, we can't help but reflect on the semester we had. SOCHI, especially, went through amazing things!</p>

  <p>This semester... SOCHI came back to life! We hosted our own design jam, partnered with SIMA and FLUX to launch the incredibly successful CONVERGE design jam, and held a series of engaging workshops (huge shoutout to Reuben, Melp, and Steven for leading those!).</p>

  <p>While we didnâ€™t break any recruitment records or top every metric, the truth is: SOCHI is in a completely different place than the beginning of the semester. We successfully completed a client project (shoutout to Tina, our incredible project manager!!!), and we couldn't be prouder of ourselves.</p>

  <p>Looking ahead... We have so many ideas for next semester. We want to expand our capacity for client projects, recruit more e-board members, and make SOCHI a bigger club than ever in its history. But we know that YOU â€” yes, dear reader â€” are the ones carrying SOCHI forward, and we are grateful for that. So thank you for showing up to the jams, for bringing energy to our workshops, and for reading this newsletter. We canâ€™t wait to see what Fall 2025 has in store. Letâ€™s keep building. ðŸ’™</p>

  <h2>Game</h2>
  <p>Steven got lost in North Quad looking for his SI 110 discussion section. Thankfully, he sent a photo to the SOCHI e-board. What room is Steven closest to in North Quad?</p>
