  <h1>SOCHI News: Newsletter 03</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Itâ€™s the end of SOCHI.</p>
  <p>SOCHI News is changingâ€”but donâ€™t worry, SOCHI isnâ€™t going anywhere! Starting next week, our newsletter will hit your inbox on Tuesdays instead of Mondays. But the club is still going strongâ€”after all, those workshops wonâ€™t teach themselves (speaking of which, thereâ€™s one tomorrow!!).</p>
  <p><em>â€“ Reuben Crasto, Steven Liu</em></p>

  <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
  <p><strong>SOCHI Portfolio Hour â€“ Tuesday</strong><br>
  Whether you're just starting or putting the final touches on your portfolio, this co-working session is the perfect space to collaborate, get feedback, and refine your work. Weâ€™ll cover portfolio best practices, showcase examples, and share ideas to help you stand out. See you there!</p>

  <h2>Sports Betting and UX</h2>
  <p>Sports betting is booming. This year, Americans are expected to place a record $1.39 billion in bets on Super Bowl LIX, and itâ€™s thanks to the meteoric rise in online betting, fueled by apps such as Draftkings and FanDuel. These apps have gamified the gambling experience (regamified?), implementing new technology such as AI. Many of these features keep users hooked, but some features can surprisingly help users curb their gambling habits.</p>

  <p><strong>Keep them hooked â€“</strong> Daily challenges, rewards systems, and AI turn betting into a video game-like experience that keeps users coming back. For example, Draftkingsâ€™ Missions are side quests that let you unlock XP, free bets, or odds boosts. Daily challenges function like Snapchat streaks, rewarding consistent playing and leading to habit-forming user experiences. With AIâ€™s predictive capabilities, bad faith actors could potentially exploit problem gamblers, predicting their gambling patterns and encouraging them to spend more than they can afford. Rumors of using ChatGPT to gain an edge in gambling may also hurt users.</p>

  <p><strong>Is there a fix? â€“</strong> However, technology may have the potential to alleviate gambling addiction. For example, Betby has been using AI to parse their appâ€™s data to identify problem gamblers based on activities such as overspending and loss chasing. A study found that finding these trends and alerting problem gamblers led to significantly decreased wager amounts, in some cases up to a 60% decrease. Some critics say AI is just a PR move, making the gambling industry appear proactive.</p>

  <p>The core of great UX is meeting users where they areâ€”understanding their needs, behaviors, and desires to create experiences that feel effortless and rewarding; gamification and AI clearly accomplish this. But just because users respond positively doesnâ€™t mean we should always give them more. Should we design for maximum engagementâ€”or for responsible engagement? Because in sports betting, the best UX isnâ€™t perhaps the most ethical one.</p>

  <h2>Making Health and Fitness Apps More Persuasive</h2>
  <p>Health and fitness apps have transformed the way people track their wellness goals, offering personalized insights, motivation, and accountability. But what makes these apps so effective at changing user behavior? The answer lies in Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs), which are scientifically proven strategies that encourage healthier habits.</p>

  <p>BCTs are small but powerful interventions embedded in app design to guide users toward positive actions. They rely on established psychological principles and causal pathways that explain how specific techniques lead to behavior change. The recent study by Klasnja et al. (2024) highlights how refining causal pathway models can enhance the precision of such interventions, making health and fitness apps even more effective.</p>

  <p>Health and fitness apps use key BCTs to drive user engagement and habit formation. Goal-setting and self-monitoring features like step counters and calorie trackers help users stay on track. Feedback and rewards, including progress bars and badges, reinforce motivation. Social support and competition through leaderboards and challenges encourage accountability. Personalization and adaptation leverage AI to tailor workouts and diet plans. Reminders and cues, such as push notifications, promote consistency. By integrating these BCTs, UX designers create persuasive experiences that drive long-term behavior change.</p>

  <h2>Game: Guess the Platform</h2>
  <p>Weâ€™ll give you cryptic UX/UI hints, historical details, and lesser-known facts. Can you guess what the website / software is? ðŸ¤”</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Countdown timer turns red in the final seconds</li>
    <li>The first-ever transaction was a broken laser pointer</li>
    <li>Among Us chicken nuggets</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> eBay (The Among Us chicken nugget sold for $99,997 btw)</p>
